# 🎨 AI Black & White Image Colorization using OpenCV & Deep Learning

This project is an AI-powered web application that converts black & white images into realistic color images using a deep learning model and OpenCV’s DNN module. The system uses a pretrained Caffe model trained on millions of natural images to predict color information from grayscale input.

The application is built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **Streamlit**, providing an easy-to-use web interface for uploading images and instantly viewing colorized results.
